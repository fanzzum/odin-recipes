        Omurice is a Japanese comfort food combining "omelet" and "rice." It features fried rice,<br>
         often flavored with ketchup and mixed with vegetables or meat, wrapped in a soft, fluffy <br>
         omelet. Typically garnished with a drizzle of ketchup, this dish is both savory and slightly<br>
          sweet, offering a delightful blend of textures and flavors.

      <h1 align="left">STEPS</h1>

      <p align="left"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS">
1. **Prepare the Fried Rice** <br> 
   Heat a tablespoon of oil or butter in a pan over medium heat. Saut√© one small finely<br> 
    chopped onion, a finely chopped small carrot, and any other vegetables like green peas<br> 
     or corn until softened. Add 150 grams of diced chicken (or your choice of protein) and cook<br> 
      it thoroughly. Stir in two cups of cooked rice, three tablespoons of ketchup, a teaspoon of <br> 
      soy sauce, and season with salt and pepper. Stir everything well and set the fried rice aside.<br> 

2. **Make the Omelet**  <br> 
   In a bowl, whisk together two eggs, a tablespoon of milk or cream (optional), and a pinch of <br> 
   salt. Heat a tablespoon of oil or butter in a non-stick pan over medium-low heat. Pour the egg <br> 
   mixture into the pan and swirl it to cover the bottom evenly. Cook gently, ensuring the omelet<br> 
    stays soft and slightly runny on top.<br> 

3. **Assemble the Omurice**  <br> 
   Once the omelet is nearly set, place half of the fried rice on one side of the omelet. Fold the<br> 
    omelet over the rice, creating a half-moon shape.<br> 

4. **Serve and Garnish** <br>  
   Slide the omelet carefully onto a plate with the seam side down. Drizzle ketchup on top and serve immediately.
