    <h1 align="left">Description</h1>
    <p align="left"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS">French toast is a delicious breakfast dish made from sliced bread<br> soaked in a mixture of eggs, milk, and spices,
     then fried until golden<br> brown. It's often served with syrup, powdered sugar, fruits or whipped<br> cream. Its crispy
      outside contrasts perfectly with a soft, fluffy interior.</font></p><br><br>

      <h1 align="left">Ingredients</h1>
      <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
              <li>Eggs (2-3 large eggs)  </li>
              <li>Milk (1/2 cup)  </li>
              <li>Sugar (1-2 tablespoons)  </li>
              <li>Vanilla extract (1 teaspoon)  </li>
              <li>Cinnamon powder (1/2 teaspoon)  </li>

              <li>Bread slices (4-6, preferably slightly stale)  </li>
              <li>Butter (for greasing the pan)  </li>
              <li>Optional toppings:<br>  
              - Syrup (e.g., maple syrup)<br>  
              - Powdered sugar<br>  
              - Fresh fruits (e.g., berries, bananas)<br>  
              - Nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts)<br>  
              - Whipped cream  </li>
      </ul><br><br>

      <h1 align="left">STEPS</h1>

      <p align="left"><font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS">
        1. **Prepare the Batter**  <br>
           Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl and whisk until smooth.  
           Add the milk, sugar, vanilla<br> extract, cinnamon powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk until everything is well combined.<br>
        
        2. **Heat the Pan**  <br>
           Place a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and let it warm up.  
           Add a<br> small pat of butter to the pan and let it melt, spreading it evenly across the surface.<br>
        
        3. **Dip the Bread**  <br>
           Take one slice of bread and dip it into the batter. Ensure both sides<br> are coated but avoid soaking it for too long, as this can make the bread soggy.<br>
        
        4. **Cook the French Toast**  <br>
           Place the battered bread slice onto the hot skillet.  
           Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the bread is golden<br> brown and slightly crisp on the edges.  
           Repeat with the remaining slices, adding more butter to the pan as needed.<br>
        
        5. **Keep Warm** <br> 
           If making a large batch, keep the cooked French toast slices warm<br> by placing them on a baking sheet in an oven set to 200°F (90°C).<br>
        
        6. **Serve**  <br>
           Stack the French toast slices on a plate.  
           Add your favorite toppings: drizzle<br> syrup, sprinkle powdered sugar, or top with fresh fruits, nuts, or whipped cream.<br></font></p>
